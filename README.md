# 🧠 Software Bug Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

Predicting software bugs before they happen using Machine Learning!  
This project implements and presents an IEEE research study on defect prediction using supervised algorithms.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Software defects increase operational cost and delay project delivery.  
This project uses **Python (Google Colab)** and **ML models** to predict bugs early in the SDLC, improving reliability and efficiency.

**Algorithms Used:**
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest 🌲  
- Naïve Bayes  

**Techniques:**
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling  
- SMOTE for Class Balancing  
- 10-Fold Cross Validation
